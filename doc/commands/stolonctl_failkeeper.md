## stolonctl failkeeper

Force keeper as "temporarily" failed. The sentinel will compute a new clusterdata considering it as failed and then restore its state to the real one.

### Synopsis

Force keeper as "temporarily" failed. It's just a one shot operation, the sentinel will compute a new clusterdata considering the keeper as failed and then restore its state to the real one. For example, if the force failed keeper is a master, the sentinel will try to elect a new master. If no new master can be elected, the force failed keeper, if really healthy, will be re-elected as master
